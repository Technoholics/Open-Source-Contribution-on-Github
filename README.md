# Open Source Contribution on Github
This is a small guide for a beginer to start open Source Contribution on Github

Many find it difficult to initial open Source Contribution. They dont know where to start. This guide is for them.

Most of project would have a file called contribution.md, this files define ways to contribute the project, Some project follow strict guidelines to allow contribution some dont. This guideline is what I feel is best because this contains set of guidelines which many project follow.

- Fork the repo you want to contribute too.
- Now clone your forked version of repo.
- on the clone repo add upstream for the original repo.
- Never work directly into the development branch, Create a branch as per the problem you are following or feature you are adding. Name them like Fix-xyz, Feature-added-new-ways-to-call, or something of that sort.
- And after making changes to the branch send Pull Request to the development Branch.
